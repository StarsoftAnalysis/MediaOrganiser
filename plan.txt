Help!

Upload a new image: e.g. duck-race-july-2009-15 -- post_id is 728
It gets a 'permalink' of http://dev.fordingbridge-rotary.org.uk/duck-race-july-2009-15/
 -- where is that stored?
    'duck-race-july-2009-15' must be stored somewhere
   -- it's post 728's post_title AND post_name
   -- changing the title on the Edit Media page changes post_title, not post_name (or permalink)
 -- it shows up as a post with name as title and a medium sized image linked to the fullsize simple image.
    i.e. http://dev.fordingbridge-rotary.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/Duck-Race-July-2009-15.jpg

Current (8/11/16) mocd code to move the image to /test/
- messes up the thumbnail in media library
- the src is OK, but there's also a srcset which has the old URL -- where is that stored??

---- all of that seems fixed when my code is working properly
